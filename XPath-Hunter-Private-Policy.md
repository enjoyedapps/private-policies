# XPath Hunter Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** September 16, 2025  
**Last Updated:** September 16, 2025

## 1. Introduction

XPath Hunter ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our service.

XPath Hunter is a developer tool designed to help web developers and testers extract XPath selectors from web page elements. Our extension provides a visual interface to hover over elements and generate XPath expressions for automated testing and web scraping purposes.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Website Content

When you use XPath Hunter, the extension accesses the DOM (Document Object Model) of the current webpage to:

- Identify and highlight elements when you hover over them
- Extract element properties (tag names, IDs, classes, text content)
- Generate XPath selectors for the selected elements

> **Important:** We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal information, user data, or website content to external servers. All processing is done locally in your browser.

### 2.2 Local Storage Data

The extension uses Chrome's local storage to save:

- Your preferred language setting
- Extension state (whether it's the first time using the extension)
- User interface preferences

This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third parties.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

The information accessed by XPath Hunter is used solely for:

- Generating XPath selectors for web elements
- Providing visual feedback when hovering over elements
- Maintaining your language and preference settings
- Improving the extension's functionality

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

> **We do NOT:**
>
> - Sell or transfer user data to third parties
> - Use or transfer user data for purposes unrelated to the extension's single purpose
> - Use or transfer user data to determine creditworthiness or for lending purposes
> - Collect personal information or browsing history
> - Transmit any data to external servers

## 5. Permissions Used

XPath Hunter requests the following permissions:

### 5.1 `activeTab`
Allows the extension to inject content scripts into the current tab to enable XPath extraction functionality.

### 5.2 `storage`
Used to save user preferences such as language settings and extension state locally on your device.

### 5.3 `contextMenus`
Provides access to XPath Hunter functionality through right-click context menu.

### 5.4 `scripting`
Required to inject content scripts dynamically into web pages for XPath extraction functionality.

### 5.5 Host Permissions
Allows the extension to work on all websites (`*://*/*`) because developers may need to extract XPath from any website they are working on or testing.

## 6. Data Security

Since all data processing occurs locally in your browser:

- No data is transmitted over the internet
- No external servers are involved in the XPath generation process
- Your browsing data remains private and secure
- Local storage data is protected by Chrome's security mechanisms

## 7. Your Rights and Controls

You have complete control over XPath Hunter:

- You can disable or uninstall the extension at any time
- You can clear local storage data through Chrome's settings
- You can choose not to use the extension on sensitive websites
- You can modify language preferences at any time

## 8. Third-Party Services

XPath Hunter does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics tools, or external APIs. The extension operates entirely independently and locally.

## 9. Children's Privacy

XPath Hunter is designed for developers and technical users. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not use this extension.
